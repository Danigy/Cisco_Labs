Download and check the Enterprise_VPN GRE Tunneling.pkt file. (Packet Tracer version 6.01)<br/>

In this lab we apply VPN GRE Tunneling between Enterprise Routers (Head and North)<br/>so that an End User at the North Office can reach the Private Enterprise Network and vice versa.<br/>

More about configuration soon....

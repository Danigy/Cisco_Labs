# 6.Enterprise--VPN_IPsec_Tunnel

Download and check the Enterprise_IPsec VPN Tunnel.pkt file. (Packet Tracer version 6.01)<br/>

In the specific lab we apply IPsec VPN connection between Enterprise Routers (Head and North), taking of advantage the security, authentication and encryption functions that IPsec provides, so that an End User at the North Office can safely reach the Private Enterprise Network and vice versa.<br/>


More about configuration soon....

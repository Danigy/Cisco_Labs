# 4.Enterprise--Public_Internet

Download and check the Enterprise_Public-Internet.pkt file. (Packet Tracer version 6.01)<br/>

In this lab the Enterprise hosts are able to access the Public Internet.<br/>
In few lines, this requires the following configuration:<br/>

1. Implementation of NAT (PAT) at the public serial interface.<br/>
2. Specify the traffic that should be translated and routed to the Internet using access lists. <br/>
3. Define ip nat inside and outside interfaces.<br/>

Also, in this task we have configured the ISP router as DHCP Server.<br/>
Thus, the public interfaces of the Enterprise Routers receive dynamically IP configuration.
